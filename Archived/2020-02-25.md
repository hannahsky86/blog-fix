Finally 30 weeks pregnant. I can't believe how active this kiddo is. It's fun to feel his little kicks and punches, but I wish he'd sleep at night!

It’s been a bit of a struggle to eat enough when appetite doesn’t always keep up with the number of calories I’m supposed to eat. So, I bought this to get at least 60 grams of protein per day. And since the baby seems to have his own workout routine, he needs to get da protein!

<h4><a id="BabyAt28Weeks">My baby is now 28 weeks</a></h4>

My little baby is now 28 weeks and things are starting to get a little more uncomfortable. This pregnancy has been pretty easy so far, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that things stay that way! Also, great news came from Boeing last week that SPEEA members will now receive 12 weeks paid family leave - which is a-mazing! I'm really excited and grateful to have so much time with my family and little baby this summer.

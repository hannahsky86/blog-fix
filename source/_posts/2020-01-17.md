<h4>Code Practice with [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)</h4>

My solution to <strong>(Between Two Sets)[https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/between-two-sets/problem]</strong>

<br>

This code ([Python](https://www.python.org/)) passed all of the tests, but I'm pretty sure there's a better way to do this. Feel free to comment and offer suggestions. Also, the HackerRank didn't allow me to import [numpy](https://numpy.org/).

<br>

"You will be given two arrays of integers and asked to determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. You must determine how many such numbers exist."

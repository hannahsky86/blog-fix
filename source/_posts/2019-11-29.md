This post describes how I added a buy button to my blog. If you just follow the steps listed on <strong>[SNIPCART](https://snipcart.com/blog/hexo-ecommerce-nodejs-blog-framework)</strong>, you should get pretty far. However, I did run into a few hiccups that were not completely obvious. The instructions below describe how I got things working. 

<br>
<br>

## 1. Sign up for Snipcart and Copy API Key 

Sign up for [Snipcart](https://app.snipcart.com/dashboard)

Go to upper right side of the screen, scroll down to <strong>ACCOUNT</strong>, and click on <strong>API KEYS</strong>

Copy your public API key and paste it in the <strong>_config.yml</strong> file 

```
snipcart_api_key: Your API Key
```

One of the nice things about Snipcart is you only have to pay for it when your site is fully tested and ready to go. You can keep Snipcart in Test mode until you're ready to start selling. 

Once you're ready to go live, you can enter your <strong>BILLING & PAYMENTS</strong> information and switch to <strong>LIVE</strong> on the <strong>API KEYS</strong> page. This will give you a new API key. Just replace your old API key with the new one in your <strong>_config.yml</strong>.

<br>
<br>

## 2. Add Buy Button to Blog 

Note: See <strong>[2019-11-17](https://www.hannahsky86.com/2019/11/17/2019-11-17/)</strong> post for how to create blog

Open your <strong>blog > themes > landscape > layout > _partial > head.ejs</strong> file and past this code just below the <head> tag

```
  <script type="text/javascript"
  id="snipcart"
  data-api-key= YOUR_API_KEY
  src="https://cdn.snipcart.com/scripts/snipcart.js">
  </script>
```

Now go to <strong>blog > themes > landscape > _partial > articles.ejs</strong> and paste the following code above footer, but within the <strong>article-entry</strong> class
 
```
        <% if (post.product) { %>
          <% if (post.product.show_image) { %>
            <img src="<%- post.product.image %>" width="30%"/>
          <% } %> 
          <div class="buy-button-position" itemprop="articleBuy">
            <button class="snipcart-add-item buy-now"
              data-item-id="<%- post.product.id %>"
              data-item-name="<%- post.product.name %>"
              data-item-price="<%- post.product.price %>"
              data-item-image="<%- post.product.image %>"
              data-item-url="<%- post.permalink %>"><%- post.product.description %></button>
          </div>
        <% } %> 
```

<br>
<br>

## 3. Format Buy Button 

Go to your <strong>blog > public > style.css</strong> file and add the following

```
.buy-now {
  text-align: center;
  border: 0;
  padding: 10px 30px;
  margin: 5px 0;
  cursor: pointer;
  border-radius: 20px;
  color: #adff2f;
  background-color: #035370;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

Then go to your <strong>blog > theme > landscape > source > css > article.styl</strong> and add 

```
.buy-button-position
{
  text-align: center
  color: #0000ff
}
.buy-now {
  text-align: center
  border: 0
  padding: 10px 30px
  margin: 5px 0
  cursor: pointer
  border-radius: 20px
  color: greenyellow
  background-color: #035370
  text-transform: uppercase
  font-weight: bold
}
```

<br>
<br>

## 4. Create a New Blog Post 

Go to <strong>blog > source > _posts</strong> and create a new post .md file

Paste this code into the file

```
---
title: Steps for a new life on Mars
date: 2019-11-25 10:38:43
product:
    id: SPACE_SUIT
    price: 1
    name: Space suit
    description: Space Suit
    permalink: https://www.hannahsky86.com/index.html
    image: /images/Aldrin_Apollo_11.jpg
    show_image: True
---
```

Now go to your terminal and type 

```
hexo generate
git add .
git commit -m "Add buy button to blog"
git push heroku master
```

<br>
<br>

## 5. Setup Payment Gateway

Go back to Snipcart and click on <strong>[PAYMENT GATEWAY](https://app.snipcart.com/dashboard/account/gateway)</strong>

Select the payment gateway that you want to use to process your payments

I chose <strong>[Squareup](https://squareup.com/dashboard/)</strong>

In the dropdown click <strong>Get Paid</strong> and work through the steps 

<br>
<br>

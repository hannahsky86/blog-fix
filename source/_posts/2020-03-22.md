My little baby is now 34 weeks along – so only six weeks till push day! I am so incredibly excited to meet this little guy and get to know his personality. It'll also be nice to have four months off work to spend time with him and the kids. It's just too bad I'll have to keep him six feet away from everyone for a while.  

Babies at 34 weeks weigh about 5lbs and are about 17-18 inches tall. One cool thing I learned this week is that babies can feel what their mother feels through the hormones that are released when they are happy, sad, stressed, etc. This can influence the baby’s brain development and mood after the baby is born. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/11/111110142352.htm So, I guess the goal is to be happy every day, listen to happy music, eat happy food, relax, and hopefully make a really happy baby!

Other updates, I am learning more about SEO and blogging. It would be pretty cool to turn blogging into a side business to build a portfolio and generate a passive income. It seems like I am starting a new course every week – this week I am studying these courses:  
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-blog/">Build a Blog</a>
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-essentials-of-blog-writing-content-creating-in-2020/">The Essentials of Blog Writing Content Creating in 2020</a>
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/wordpress-blogging-master-class/">WordPress Blogging Master Class</a>

The biggest thing I’ve learned so far is that the blog content should be focused and useful. So, I need to get better content and create a separate blog for each area of focus; personal blog, data science, app development, robotics, and elementary education. I also think it would probably be easier to switch to WordPress in order to make use of the SEO plug-ins and webstore features.

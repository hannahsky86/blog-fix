<h4><a id="WpfRealWorldApp"> YouTube Real World App Tutorial </a></h4>

I am in the process of learning to build WPF applications using the .NET Framework. This is for work and my own projects. Yesterday I started [Learning Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-wpf-course/learn/lecture/8759918?start=0#overview) through Udemy, but... I almost died from boredom. J/k, kudos to the person who put it together - it's a lot of work to build an entire course for Udemy. It's actually pretty good for learning the basics of WPF, but it's not the best if you're looking for real world coding examples. I found this tutorial, [WPF Real World App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK3wd7ta20U&list=PLlaap3dYFdbm8wYYzIyJ5m8SORVQZgFG6), on YouTube that I think I'll check out tomorrow. Once I'm done with this, I'll start working on my app. 

Update: This guy never finished the YouTube tutorial. I guess that is why Udemy is so popular. Moving on to something else.

<h4><a id="BabyAt28Weeks">My baby is now 28 weeks</a></h4>

My little baby is now 28 weeks and things are starting to get a little more uncomfortable. This pregnancy has been pretty easy so far, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that things stay that way! Also, great news came from Boeing last week that SPEEA members will now receive 12 weeks paid family leave - which is a-mazing! I'm really excited and grateful to have so much time with my family and little baby this summer.

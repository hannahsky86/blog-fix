<h4><a id="WpfRealWorldApp"> YouTube Real World App Tutorial </a></h4>

I am in the process of learning to build WPF applications using the .NET Framework. This is for work and my own projects. Yesterday I started [Learning Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-wpf-course/learn/lecture/8759918?start=0#overview) through Udemy, but... I almost died from boredom. J/k, kudos to the person who put it together - it's a lot of work to build an entire course for Udemy. It's actually pretty good for learning the basics of WPF, but it's not the best if you're looking for real world coding examples. I found this tutorial, [WPF Real World App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK3wd7ta20U&list=PLlaap3dYFdbm8wYYzIyJ5m8SORVQZgFG6), on YouTube that I think I'll check out tomorrow. Once I'm done with this, I'll start working on my app. 

Update: This guy never finished the YouTube tutorial. I guess that is why Udemy is so popular. Moving on to something else.

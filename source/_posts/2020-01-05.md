The following are my notes on how to get up and running with Apache Tomcat.


<h2> <a id="Step1" >Install Java</a> 
</h2> 

Go to https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html 

Click on <strong>Java SE 11</strong> or <strong>Java SE 13</strong>

Click on the <strong>Oracle JDK</strong> download button 

Under the <strong>Java SE Development Kit</strong> box, accept the license agreement and click on the <strong>maxOS dmg</strong> download link 

A warning may appear saying <strong>"This type of file can harm your computer. Do you want to keep jdk-13.0.1_osx...dmg anyway?" </strong>

Click <strong>Keep</strong> 

Double-click the box icon to install 

The <strong>Install JDK 13.0.1</strong> window will appear 

Click <strong>Continue</strong>

Click <strong>Install</strong>

You may need to enter your macOS password 

Click <strong>Continue</strong>

You should then see <strong>Install Succeeded </strong> in the install window

Click <strong>Close</strong>

A window may appear asking if you want to move the <strong>JDK 13.0.1</strong> Installer to the Trash

Click <strong>Move to Trash</strong>

Now open your terminal window to check that the correct version of Java was installed 

Enter 

``` 
java -version 
```

You should see 

```
java 13.0.1 2019-10-15
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 13.0.1+9)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 13.0.1+9, mixed mode, sharing)
```

In your terminal, enter 

```
cd ~/
vim .bash_profile
```

Type i and then enter

On the last line enter

```
export JAVA_HOME=$(/user/libexec/java_home)
```

Click the <strong>esc</strong> key

Enter <strong>:x</strong> then enter

This should save and close vim 

<br>

<h2> <a id="Step2" >Install Apache Tomcat</a> 
</h2> 

Go to http://tomcat.apache.org/ 

On the left side of the page under <strong>Download </strong>, click on <strong>Tomcat 9</strong>


Under <strong>9.0.30</strong>, <strong>Binary Distributions</strong>, <strong>Core</strong>, click on <strong>tar.gz(gpg, sha512)</strong> 

Open your <strong>Downloads</strong> directory in your <strong>Finder</strong> window

Right-click > Open With > Archive Utility.app 

In your terminal type 

```
cd /usr/local
sudo mv ~/Downloads/apache-tomcat-9.0.30 /usr/local
```

Enter your maxOS password

```
sudo rm -f /Library/Tomcat
sudo ln -s /usr/local/apache-tomcat-9.0.30 /Library/Tomcat 
```

Get your username with

```
whoami
```

Then enter 

```
sudo chown -R username /Library/Tomcat
sudo chmod +x /Library/Tomcat/bin/*.sh
```

To start Apache Tomcat, cd into your <strong>/Library/Tomcat/bin/</strong> directory and type <strong>startup.sh</strong>

```
cd /Library/Tomcat
bin/startup.sh
```

You should then see the following in your terminal window 

```
Using CATALINA_BASE:   /Library/Tomcat
Using CATALINA_HOME:   /Library/Tomcat
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /Library/Tomcat/temp
Using JRE_HOME:        /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-13.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home
Using CLASSPATH:       /Library/Tomcat/bin/bootstrap.jar:/Library/Tomcat/bin/tomcat-juli.jar
Tomcat started.
```

Check that the server is started by going to a browser and entering <strong>localhost:8080</strong>

You should see the Apache Tomcat/9.0.30 and a note saying <strong>"If you're seeing this, you've successfully installed Tomcat. Congratulations!" </strong>

If you don't see that message, leave a comment and I will try to help! 

Shut down the server with 

```
cd /Library/Tomcat
bin/startup.sh
```

<h2> <a id="Step3" >Install Eclipse</a> 
</h2> 

Go to https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/

Under <strong>Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers</strong>, click on <strong>Mac Cocoa 64-bit</strong>

On the next page you will see an orange <strong>Download</strong> button and a dmg link 

Click on <strong>eclipse-jee-2019-12-R-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.dmg </strong>

You may see a warning; if so, click <strong>Keep</strong>

Open the dmg file 

Move the <strong>Eclipse.app</strong> icon to the <strong>Applications</strong> folder 

Go to your Applications folder and click on the Eclipse icon

Eclipse may open directly to the Welcome page

If not, go to <strong>Help>Welcome</strong>

Click on <strong>Create a new Java EE Web Project </strong>

A window titled <strong>New Dynamic Web Project</strong> will open

Change the project name

Click on <strong>New Runtime </strong>

Click on <strong>Apache Tomcat v9.0</strong>

Click <strong>Next</strong>

Click <strong>Browse</strong>

Find the <strong>Library/Tomcat</strong> directory

Click <strong>Open</strong>

Click <strong>Finish</strong>

Click <strong>Finish</strong> again

Under your project <strong>WebContent</strong> directory, click <strong>New > JSP File</strong>

You will see a new window titled <strong> New JSP File </strong>

Choose a file name

Click <strong>Finish</strong>

Enter some unique text in the <strong> body </strong> section of your file 

Save your file 

Towards the bottom of the page you should see a link that says <strong>"No servers are available. Click this link to create a new server."</strong>

Click on <strong>Tomcat v9.0 Server</strong> 

Click <strong>Next</strong>

Click on your project name and then click <strong>Add <strong>

Click <strong>Finish</strong>

Towards the bottom right side of the page you will see a little green start button 

Click this start button to start the server 

Now, open a browser window and go to <strong>localhost:8080/< ProjectName >/< JSPFileName ></strong>

For example, if your project name were SuperCoolProject and your JSP file name were HelloWorld.jsp, you would enter <strong>localhost:8080/SuperCoolProject/HelloWorld.jsp</strong> in the browser window

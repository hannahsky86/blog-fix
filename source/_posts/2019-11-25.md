"I have read a lot recently about Elon Musk and the SpaceX program. Enough that I’m now convince that we will colonize Mars really soon. I don’t know about you, but I prefer to be ready when this new revolution happens so I’ve decided to start gearing up for the big adventure. I want to share with you what stock I’ve been gathering lately for my new life on the red planet. Exciting isn’t it?

First and foremost, the space suit. You’ll spend a lot of time in it so it’s necessary to find one that you will like and that will fit you. Still I’m showing you the one I chose because I’m pretty proud of it and I think it’s a good economic choice. It’s white and comfy and I’m already wearing it when I sleep, so I can get use to it you know? You can buy it from this page actually, check it out!

<h4><a id="HackerRank">Code practice with 
<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard">HackerRank</a></h4>

My solution to <strong>[Between Two Sets](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/between-two-sets/problem)</strong>: <strong><a href="2020/01/18/between-two-sets">SOLUTION</a></strong>

<br>

<h4><a id="GoogleAdsense"> My blog is monitized with <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense">Google AdSense</a></a></strong>!</h4>

So far, I am really happy with <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/adsense">Google AdSense</a></strong>. The ads are not too obnoxious and it's fun to check stats on clicks, page views, impressions, etc. Getting setup with <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/adsense">Google AdSense</a></strong> was really simple; just sign up and paste the code in your header. Getting approved takes a few days.

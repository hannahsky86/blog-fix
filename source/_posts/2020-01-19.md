<h4><a id="GoogleAdsense"> My blog is monitized with <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense">Google AdSense</a></a></strong>!</h4>

So far, I am really happy with <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/adsense">Google AdSense</a></strong>. The ads are not too obnoxious and it's fun to check stats on clicks, page views, impressions, etc. Getting setup with <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/adsense">Google AdSense</a></strong> was really simple; just sign up and paste the code in your header. Getting approved takes a few days.

My solution to <strong>[Between Two Sets](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/between-two-sets/problem)</strong>

This code ([Python](https://www.python.org/)) passed all of the tests, but I'm pretty sure there's a better way to do this. Feel free to comment and offer suggestions. Also, the HackerRank didn't allow me to import [numpy](https://numpy.org/).

"You will be given two arrays of integers and asked to determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. You must determine how many such numbers exist."

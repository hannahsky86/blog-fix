<h4>Starting a YouTube Developer Channel</h4>
 Alright, it’s time to get serious about my YouTube channel. 
 I purchased a light, microphone, and writing pad and am just waiting for my Amazon packages to arrive. I also read <a href="">The YouTube Formula</a> by Derral Eves and archived the old content on my channel. I’m definitely excited to get started.

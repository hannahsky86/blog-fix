This week I am studying <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/">Become a WordPress Developer: Unlocking Power With Code</a>. 

I am not making notes on this one since this course is 27 hours long and I want to get through it! I've also decided to focus on building the elementary education website. It seems like this might be the most marketable of my website ideas. I already have a YouTube following with my phonics/whole-word videos, so once the website is finished, I can link it to my YouTube channel. Ideally, I'd like to create phonics/whole-word games, interactive phonics books, and printouts for my website and then sell educational products through my webstore.

<h4>Other Updates</h4>

Things have been pretty boring since this COVID pandemic. This week we snuck out of the house to get <a href="https://www.tonyburgers.com/#home-section">TONYBURGERS</a> takeout.
